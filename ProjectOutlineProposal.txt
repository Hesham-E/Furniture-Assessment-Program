ENSF 409 Proposed outline
*JVanderstoop*

program flow: 
		- output guidlines through the terminal for useage of the program, 
			such as allowed inputs, and how to access the outputs 

		- intake user input through terminal in the provided form

		- manipulate the input (regex probably) into strings for each search 
			parameter of the desired furniture
			- quantity to int

		- access the database 

		- use the type and category to build an object specified by the user 
			- see examples of every type of furniture in inventory.sql, 
				we can build objects using the TABLES and have data 
				that match each table
	
		- compare the possible combination in which every boolean for the required object 
			has turned true, and compare the prices.
	
		- once there cannot be a lowest price, return the needed values for the newly made piece 
			to be displayed, and format the output file.

		- if no possible combination is present, display the error messages and the manufacturers
			of new furniture required
		
		- delete the objects 'bought' (if any) from the database, then close the database 
	

		- end the program 


Possible classes/methods:
		
		- File I/O class
			- contains the main method (handles IO exceptions)
				- prompts for user input
				- sends the user input to the proper strings/ints
				- creates the Furniture class object 
				- sends for the DataBase class to begin (which opens the calculator(which opens FormattedForm and UpdateDataBase))
				- if DataBase and calculator are not successful, prints error messages to the terminal  

		- Furniture class 
			- contains private classes for each TABLE currently present in the database
				- strings, booleans as data members
				- getters, setters constructors
			- gives the user input furniture type to DataBase 
			- gives an object of user input furniture type to Calculator Class


		- DataBase class
			- opens database
			- accessed in the File I/0 class and allows for searching each possible row of the table using the given 
				user input furniture type 
			- constructs a 2d array of strings as ID, booleans,  and price to send back to the Furniture class
				each row is one peice of furniture that matches the user input type. 
			- passes this array into Calculator class 
			- can be used to access manufacturer details if needed from Calculator
			- closes database

		- Calculator class 
			- uses the 2d array and some clever parsing to find different combinations of the given object type
			- compares the resulting price of each combination
			- sends the ID numbers of used furniture back to the UpdateDataBase class for deleting from the table
			- if any part of the new object isnt satisfied, ie. there was no combination, gives the manufacturer 
				ID back to the DataBase class for error and manufacturer output 
			- otherwise uses the FormattedForm to output the product. 
		
		- UpdateDataBase class
			- opens database 
			- receives the ID numbers of used furniture and deletes it from the database 
			- closes database

		- FormattedForm class
			- gets the user input type, quantity, ID numbers deleted from the database, and total price
			- opens the output stream
			- builds everything to the specifications provided in orderform.txt
			- sends to the output file, which will have to be hardcoded (no command line args)
			- closes the output stream
